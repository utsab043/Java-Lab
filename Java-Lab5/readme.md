# Filehandeling in Java

## FileWriter
   
  FileWriter is useful to create a file writing characters into it.

* This class inherits from the OutputStream class.
* The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are acceptable. To specify these values yourself, construct an OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream.
* FileWriter is meant for writing streams of characters. For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileOutputStream.
* FileWriter creates the output file , if it is not present already.

### Constructors:

* FileWriter(File file) – Constructs a FileWriter object given a File object.
* FileWriter (File file, boolean append) – constructs a FileWriter object given a File object.
* FileWriter (FileDescriptor fd) – constructs a FileWriter object associated with a file descriptor.
* FileWriter (String fileName) – constructs a FileWriter object given a file name.
* FileWriter (String fileName, Boolean append) – Constructs a FileWriter object given a file name with a Boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written.

### Methods:

* public void write (int c) throws IOException – Writes a single character.
* public void write (char [] stir) throws IOException – Writes an array of characters.
* public void write(String str)throws IOException – Writes a string.
* public void write(String str,int off,int len)throws IOException – Writes a portion of a string. Here off is offset from which to start writing characters and len is number of character to write.
* public void flush() throws IOException flushes the stream
* public void close() throws IOException flushes the stream first and then closes the writer

## FileReader

  FileReader is useful to read data in the form of characters from a ‘text’ file.

* This class inherit from the InputStreamReader Class.
* The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are appropriate. To specify these values yourself, construct an InputStreamReader on a FileInputStream.
* FileReader is meant for reading streams of characters. For reading streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileInputStream.

### Constructors:

* FileReader(File file) – Creates a FileReader , given the File to read from
* FileReader(FileDescripter fd) – Creates a new FileReader , given the FileDescripter to read from
* FileReader(String fileName) – Creates a new FileReader , given the name of the file to read from

### Methods:

* public int read () throws IOException – Reads a single character. This method will block until a character is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
* public int read(char[] cbuff) throws IOException – Reads characters into an array. This method will block until some input is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
* public abstract int read(char[] buff, int off, int len) throws IOException –Reads characters into a portion of an array. This method will block until some input is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
  Parameters:
1)cbuf – Destination buffer
2)off – Offset at which to start storing characters
3)len – Maximum number of characters to read
* public void close() throws IOException closes the reader.
* public long skip(long n) throws IOException –Skips characters. This method will block until some characters are available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
Parameters:
n – The number of characters to skip
